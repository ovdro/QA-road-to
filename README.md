# QA.road-to

This is a collection of examples of my test artifacts and other things made during training.

First of all, I would like to leave here a link to an excellent [article](https://dou.ua/forums/topic/40666/) by [Natalia Popelyushko](https://dou.ua/users/nataliia-popelyshko/) on [DOU](https://dou.ua/), which contains all currently known types of testing.
As I explore these types, I will add links to interesting materials on the topic.
